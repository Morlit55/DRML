### Known Versions & Differences: 

There are two distinct versions that have been cataloged so far. One version displays a "Checking media" screen before attempting to start the game (Redump entries [31422](http://redump.org/disc/31422) and [85070](http://redump.org/disc/85070/)), and another displays an error message that says "Trwa weryfikacja nośnika. Proszę czekać…", which translates to "Media verification is in progress. Please wait…" (IA item ["speed-pack"](https://archive.org/details/speed-pack)).

Cenega error window present in IA item ["speed-pack"](https://archive.org/details/speed-pack):

!["Cenega" - "Virtual drive was detected please insert original disc in drive." - "Check disk" - "Cancel"](Cenega_ProtectDVD_Error_Message.png "Cenega error window.")

Cenega "Media verification" window present in Redump entries [31422](http://redump.org/disc/31422) and [85070](http://redump.org/disc/85070/):

### Categories: 

Optical Copy Protection

### Protection Features:

Virtual Drive Detection

### Minimum Required Image Format to Run:

ISO[^8]

### Software Known to Detect:

BurnOut [^5], BinaryObjectScanner[^6], ProtectionID[^7]

### Detection Related Information:

https://github.com/SabreTools/BinaryObjectScanner/blob/master/BinaryObjectScanner/Protection/CenegaProtectDVD.cs

### Preservation Instructions:

A simple ISO dump of these games appears to suffice, as all the protection features currently known only detect virtual drive use. [TODO: Verify if (and if applicable, how) this DRM checks for burned discs.]

### Overall Description:

Cenega ProtectDVD is a Polish DVD copy protection created by the publisher Cenega. It verifies the authenticity of the disc through, at a minimum, virtual drive detection. In Redump entries [31422](http://redump.org/disc/31422) and [85070](http://redump.org/disc/85070/), mounting an ISO file as a SCSI virtual drive in Daemon Tools is seemingly enough to pass this check. A DT virtual drive doesn't work, and is presumably checked for by the DRM. Strangely, IDE virtual drives appear to crash the game at the protection check, though this doesn't appear to be an intentional protection feature. IA item ["speed-pack"](https://archive.org/details/speed-pack) specifically needs the ISO to be mounted to a physical drive in order to pass the protection check. This has been confirmed (but not by me) to be sufficient to allow the game to load at least in to the main game menu. Gameplay itself is untested.

It also appears to have a trial-ware component, based on strings such as "Trial period will expire after one execution." present in "cenega.dll". It is currently unknown if/when this is actually put to use, and further investigation on if they distributed trials of games online is needed.

[^8]: ISO is confirmed to allow the games to begin in Redump entries [31422](http://redump.org/disc/31422) and [85070](http://redump.org/disc/85070/) when mounted as a SCSI virtual drive using Daemon Tools, gameplay not thoroughly tested. IA item ["speed-pack"](https://archive.org/details/speed-pack) is confirmed to pass the protection check into at least the main game menu when mounted specifically to a physical drive using Daemon Tools. Unlike the rest of the samples, using a SCSI virtual drive doesn't pass the protection check.

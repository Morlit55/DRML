### Overall Description:

Denuvo Anti-Cheat is a form of anti-cheat, though information on what games use it is rather sparse. It's known to have been in development since at least 2017[^Denuvo_Website_2017]. In 2018, Irdeto mentioned how Denuvo Anti-Cheat would be "soon to be launched as a full end-to-end solution"[^Denuvo_esports_Blog]. It also appears that Denuvo started providing anti-cheat services for Ubisoft in 2019, and this appears to still be active as of 2023[^Chinese_Ubisoft_Denuvo_PDF]. Which game or games are protected is unclear, but due to this information seemingly only being available in this document (as far as I'm able to find), which itself is only available in Chinese, it may be that this service is being used for China-exclusive games. The document also states:

>由于Ubisoft实施了Denuvo的反作弊解决方案，迄今为止共有112个作弊工具开发者被识别和清除。

Translated to English via Google Translate:

>As a result of Ubisoft's implementation of Denuvo's anti-cheat solution, a total of 112 cheat developers have been identified and removed to date.

Assuming this information is correct, this essentially confirms that Denuvo Anti-Cheat has been around since presumably 2019, with some level of success.
This predates the first documented game to have used Denuvo Anti-Cheat, which is Doom Eternal. It was added in Update 1[^DOOM_Eternal_Update_1] on 2020-05-14, before being completely removed in Update 1.1[^DOOM_Eternal_Update_1.1] on 2020-05-27 (less than 2 weeks later!). It's been explicitly stated that the removal was due to the community's negative response, not any issues with Denuvo Anti-Cheat itself.[^DOOM_Eternal_DAC_Removal] Since then, there have been several documents released by Irdeto about it, as well as a few other games confirmed to have it. The documents include a Q&A about the Denuvo Anti-Cheat kernel-mode driver[^DAC_Kernel-Mode_FAQ], an updated datasheet[^DAC_Datasheet], and a case study about Denuvo & Ubisoft regarding anti-cheat[^Chinese_Ubisoft_Denuvo_PDF]. 

It has been somewhat difficult to find examples of games that use Denuvo Anti-Cheat, presumably partially due to the fact that it considers itself a "white-label solution"[^DAC_Website_2023], which would allow itself to be rebranded for customer use. 

Interestingly, the Q&A about the driver[^DAC_Kernel-Mode_FAQ] says that Denuvo Anti-Cheat is only installed and ran when competitive multiplayer is used. This means that this was done sometime after 2020, as the version used in Doom Eternal was known to be installed at launch and was required for singleplayer features.[^DOOM_Eternal_DAC_Removal] This does appear to have been implemented by late 2021, as the game "Zero Hour" states that Denuvo Anti-Cheat is only installed when a certain game mode is played.[^Zero_Hour_QOL_Update]

Denuvo Anti-Cheat itself works via a kernel-mode driver[^DAC_Website_2023] that allows the anti-cheat to monitor the game processes and the Windows kernel to send the information along to the server, where all the actual checks take place[^DAC_Datasheet]. There, the game company can decide if cheating is actually occurring, and what to do about it.

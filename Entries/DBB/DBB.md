#### Untested:

* Don't Bother Burn (DBB):[^DBB_Product_Page] Standard edition of DBB. It is unknown how this works exactly, but at minimum it appears to have obfuscated the game executable and likely included a disc check as well.
* Don't Bother Burn Protection Suite (DBB PS):[^DBB_PS_Product_Page] Enhanced edition of DBB. It appears to have added further development and support options to software developers. This includes placing validity checks at specific points in the game, to throw off cracking attempts.
* DBB 3.0: Released in late 2001. Supposedly, it was considered very favorably by potential customers.[^DBB_Ready_for_Launch_PR] It also added "new protection schemes and functionality", but the specifics are unknown.[^Wkit_Sonopress_PR]

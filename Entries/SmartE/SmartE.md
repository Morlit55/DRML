## Overall Description:

"SmartE" is the common name for a copy protection suite consisting of 8[^SmartE_rundown] (later 4)[^SmartE_rundown2] different components developed by the Texas based company Smarte Solutions[^SmartE_website1][^SmartE_website2] (later calling themselves Vincera, Inc).[^Vincera_website] Out of these 8, the one this article will mostly focus on is called SmarteSECURE, a bad-sector based optical media protection scheme that became famous for being featured in several games published by Microsoft Game Studios between 2003 and 2006[^SmartE_Microsoft_Partnership]. SmarteSECURE itself was also protected by the either the Crunch packer, licensed from BitArts Labs or possibly SmartE's own SmarteLOCK.[^Crunch_and_SmarteLOCK].

## Versions & Differences: 

#### Tested:

* SmarteSECURE 3.0.0.0[^Smartsecure1][^Smartsecure2][^Smartesecure3][^Smartesecure_version]

Only known version of SmarteSECURE used by all known Microsoft Game Studios releases. 10 erroneous sectors is inserted into disc through SmarteMaster in a way so they overlap a file called "0002.tmp", making it unreadable under normal circumstances. Upon launch an executable will be extracted from the gameâ€™s main executable (both protected by either Crunch or possible SmarteLOCK) known as the "SmartE Protection Stub" which will attempt to read the portion of 0002.tmp that doesn't overlap any errors. And if successful the game will launch.

[^Smartesecure_version]: Version taken from the Protection stub

* SmarteMASTER[^SmarteMaster]

A program used to create Smarte Master Discs. Licensed to Microsoft alongside SmarteSECURE and presumably all games using SmartE was made using it.[^SmarteMASTER_Beta] 

[^SmarteMaster]: [SmarteMaster Data sheet](https://web.archive.org/web/20041216005007/http://www.smartesolutions.com/docs/smartemaster_dec03.pdf)

[^SmarteMASTER_Beta]: [Determined using a Beta version of Zoo Tycoon 2: Marine Mania seemingly leaked during production with references to SmarteMASTER in its code.](https://archive.org/details/zoo_tycoon_2_protos)


#### Untested:

* SmarteCD[^SmartE_rundown]:
The oldest part of the suite. Believed to be inserting a trigger into a game's code that would eventually stop you from playing if it detected an illegal copy. No examples have been found and discontinued in late 2003. Possibly integrated into SmarteSECURE.
* SmarteMANAGER[^SmartE_rundown]:
A Licensing management solution. No examples have been found so far.
* SmarteKEY[^SmartE_rundown]:
Online activation manager. No examples have been found so far.
* SmartePAY[^SmartE_rundown]:
Secure e-payment solution. Discontinued in late 2003
* SmarteMEDIA[^SmartE_rundown]:
Protection for recordable CD media. Discontinued in late 2003 and possibly integrated into SmarteSECURE.
* SmarteLOCK[^SmartE_rundown]:
A packer incorporating technology from Fusion and Crunch from BitArts Labs. Might have been used in the Microsoft published games but this is uncomfirmed.

## Supported Platforms:

* Microsoft Windows CD-ROM.[^Smartsecure2]

***

## Software Known to Detect:

* ProtectionID[^PID]
* BinaryObjectScanner[^BOS_List]
* A-Ray Scanner[^A-Ray_List]
* Yara rules[^Yara_List] (Through Detect It Easy)[^DIE]

Note the exception of BinaryObjectScanner none of these are 100% reliable. A SmarteSECURE game can otherwise be identified by the presence of 0002.tmp and the SmartE Protection Stub.

## Preservation Instructions:

The bad sectors will cause errors during dumping and might trip up some unprepared drives. Same technology used to dump SafeDisc games work on SmartE though.[^SmartEDumping]

[^SmartEDumping]: [Redump guide to dumping SmartE and SafeDisc games](http://wiki.redump.org/index.php?title=IBM_PC:_SafeDisc_/_SmartE_protection)

*** 

## Associated File Attributes:

### File Names

#### "0002.tmp":

Dummy file which the bad sectors partly overlap. Without it's presence a smartE protected game won't pass a disc check.

#### "ins*.tmp"

The SmartE Protection Stub that performs the Disc Check. It takes on several different names but always start with "ins" and is folowed by between 1-4 random letters/numbers.

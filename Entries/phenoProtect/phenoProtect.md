### Overall Description:

The DRM phenoProtect was a copy protection created by Codecult,[^5] whose parent company at the time was Phenomedia AG.[^8] In 2002, Phenomedia AG became insolvent,[^12] and Codecult would become part of "H2Labs Creative Research GmbH" as of 2002-08-28.[^14] It seems that phenoProtect, both in branding and technology, was abandoned as of this point.

It was seemingly used in several games during this time period, but the only one currently confirmed is "Carrera Grand Prix"[^9]. PhenoProtect itself seems to make use of a "signature" using bad sectors on the disc to validate the authenticity of the media. The exact type of errors aren't currently known, but don't appear to be C2 errors. 

The main protection check is triggered during installation, and appears to be implemented entirely within the InstallShield compiled script. There's a secondary disc check present when attempting to launch the game itself, though this appears to only check for the presence of the disc, no signature check is apparently performed. It's currently unknown if this disc check is part of phenoProtect itself, or if this was an extra check added by the game developers. Further testing is required, as I haven't been personally able to run the game whatsoever. This, however, appears to be a game crash and not a failed protection check.
